# beyond-light
1st person game created in a team of eight as a part of a 48-hour gaming hackathon (McGame Jam, McGill). 
Gameplay mechanics include a full-motion first-person character, a main menu, a pause menu (with the letter p), and an eagle-vision feature (with the letter v) for a clue.
My team and I made all the music and sound effects completely from scratch, making us stand out in the design aspect. As well, the game is interactive and uses logical reasoning and motion control.
The project was created using C# and the Unity platform. My task was to design and implement a fully functional user UI in a 3D game.
